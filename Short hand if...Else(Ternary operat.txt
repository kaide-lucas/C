Short hand if...Else(Ternary operator)

	There is also a short-hand if else, which is as the TERNARAY OPERATOR because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

Syntax:
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;

Example:
int time = 20;
if (time < 18){
	printf("Good day.");
} else {
	printf("Good evening.");
} 

You can simply write:
int time = 20;
(time < 18) ? printf("Good day.") : printf("Good evening.");
